# Decision Log (ADR-lite)

Purpose:
- Capture architecturally significant decisions
- Provide "why" alongside "what"
- Make senior engineer review easy
- Enable reversal without confusion (decisions can be superseded, not deleted)

Format:
- Keep entries small
- Include alternatives considered
- Include consequences / tradeoffs

## Decisions

### [0001] Example: Use JSONL for agent tool tracing logs
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  

**Context:**
We need append-only logs that can be parsed line-by-line during agent loops.

**Decision:**
Store tool calls in `.ralph/tool_trace.jsonl` (newline-delimited JSON objects).

**Alternatives considered:**
1) Single JSON array file rewritten each loop
2) Plain text logs only

**Why this choice:**
JSON Lines supports incremental writing and streaming processing.

**Consequences / tradeoffs:**
- Pros: append-only, easy to parse per record
- Cons: not “one valid JSON document” end-to-end

**Revisit if:**
We require strict JSON documents for ingestion into a system that rejects JSONL.

### [0002] Add Unique ID to InterviewSession
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-01-13

**Context:**
Users reported "ghosting" where old session state (answers/transcripts) appeared in new sessions. The existing `InterviewSession` type lacked a unique identifier to reliably distinguish strictly between "reset" sessions and "new" sessions across component mounts.

**Decision:**
Add an optional `id` fields (UUID) to the `InterviewSession` interface.

**Alternatives considered:**
1) Rely on `currentQuestionIndex === 0` (fragile)
2) Rely on `answers` object emptiness (unreliable if persistence lags)

**Why this choice:**
Explicit ID allows components to subscribe to `session.id` changes and force-reset local state immediately.

**Consequences / tradeoffs:**
- Pros: Deterministic cleanup triggers.
- Cons: Minor migration friction for existing persisted sessions (optional field mitigates this).

**Revisit if:**
We move to a fully server-side session management model where local ID is irrelevant.
